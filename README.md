# rag-anythingllm

This repository contains the manifests and resources required to deploy a Generative AI (GenAI) GUI with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. The project is designed to simplify the deployment of a scalable and efficient GenAI solution.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`gui_anythingllm/`**: Contains Kubernetes manifests for deploying the GenAI GUI

- **`milvus/`**: Contains resources for deploying Milvus, a vector database used for efficient similarity search and retrieval

- **`model_ollama/`**: Contains manifests for deploying the Ollama model service


## Prerequisites

Before deploying the solution, ensure you have the following:

- A Kubernetes cluster (e.g., OpenShift, Minikube, or any managed Kubernetes service).
  - <span style="color:orange;"> **Notice**: At the moment, the deployment works only on an OpenShift cluster!
- `kubectl` or `oc` CLI tools installed and configured.
- Sufficient storage and compute resources for the deployment.
- Access to the required container images for the GUI, Milvus, and Ollama model.

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Deploy Milvus**:

    - We will install Milvus based on the insttuction from this link [Milvus on OpenShift](https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/llm-on-openshift/tree/main/vector-databases/milvus). Accordingly, I have generated the manifest for a standalone deployment.
   - Navigate to the `milvus/` directory.
   - Apply the standalone manifest:
     ```sh
     kubectl apply -f milvus_manifest_standalone.yaml
     ```

2. **Deploy the GenAI GUI**:
   - Navigate to the `gui_anythingllm/` directory.
   - Apply the manifests in the following order:
     ```sh
     kubectl apply -f all_resources.yaml
     ```

3. **Deploy the Ollama Model Service**:
   - Navigate to the `model_ollama/` directory.
   - Apply the manifests in the following order:
     ```sh
     kubectl apply -f all_resources.yaml
     ```

4. **Verify the Deployment**:
   - Check the status of the pods:
     ```sh
     kubectl get pods
     ```
   - Ensure all pods are running without errors.

5. **Access the GUI**:
   - Use the route URL generated by openshift to access the GenAI GUI.
